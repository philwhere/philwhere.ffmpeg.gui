# philwhere.ffmpeg.gui
A tool to simplify MY frequently used FFMPEG CLI commands

This tool is designed to be used with only video.  
It just launches CMD with the shown FFMPEG commands, so you need FFMPEG to run it.

# The goods

Drag and drop your video into the window and you will find **three basic functionalities**.
1. Change container. e.g. ts → mp4 or mkv

2. Change aspect ratio. e.g. 4:3 → 16:9

3. Fix a video with bad stereo by downmixing it into mono

Ignore is the default option for 2 and 3 as they are less commonly used for me. Uncheck to activate function.
